Task 1: Create a comparison chart highlighting the differences between LAN and WAN, including speed, distance, and usage scenarios.
Solution:
LAN (Local Area Network) ---> Hight speed , Short distance , File sharing/video conferencing withing a local network.
WAN (Wide Area Network) ---> Lower speed , Long distance , connecting multiple LANs across different locations , remote access to resources.

Exercise 1: : Identify and describe a real-world scenario where each type of network would be used.
Solution:
LAN:
Scenario: A small office with 10 employees needs to share files, printers, and internet access.
Network Type: LAN ( A LAN is ideal for this scenario because it allows for high-speed, reliable communication within a limited geographical area.)
WAN:
Scenario: A multinational corporation with offices in multiple countries needs to connect its employees and resources globally.   
Network Type: WAN. (A WAN is necessary to connect geographically dispersed locations to establish reliable and high speed connections).

Exercise 2: Explain the differences between public and private IP addresses, and provide examples of each.
Solution:

Public IP Addresses
Unique: Each device connected to the internet has a unique public IP address.   
Global: Accessible from anywhere on the internet.   
Assigned by ISP: Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign public IP addresses to their customers.   
Example: 172.217.16.142

Private IP Addresses
Non-unique: Multiple devices within a private network can share the same private IP address.
Local: Only accessible within a private network (like a home or office network).   
Assigned by Router: Routers assign private IP addresses to devices connected to them.   
Example: 192.168.1.100


Task 3:  Write a brief explanation of the TCP/IP model and its significance in networking.
Solution:
The TCP/IP model is a fundamental framework for computer networking. It defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices. It consists of four layers:

1. Application Layer: This layer includes protocols that enable applications to
communicate over the network, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
2. Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and error
recovery. The two main protocols in this layer are:
• TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission through error checking and retransmission of lost packets.
• UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A connectionless protocol that allows for faster data transmission without the overhead of error checking and retransmission, making it suitable for applications like video streaming and online gaming.
3. Internet Layer: This layer is responsible for routing packets across the network. The primary protocol here is IP, which handles addressing and routing.
4. Link Layer: This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over network media, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi.




Task 4: Write a brief comparison of TCP vs. UDP, highlighting use cases for each.
Solution:
TCP:
Reliable: Ensures data is delivered correctly and in order.
Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
Slow: Due to error checking and retransmission mechanisms.
High Overhead: Requires additional header information for each packet.
Use Cases:
File transfer (FTP)
Email (SMTP)
Web browsing (HTTP)
Remote login (SSH)
UDP:
Unreliable: Does not guarantee data delivery or order.
Connectionless: Data is sent in packets without establishing a connection.
Fast: Lower overhead and no retransmissions.
Low Overhead: Minimal header information.
Use Cases:
Real-time streaming (VoIP, video conferencing)
Online gaming
DNS (Domain Name System)
Network time protocols (NTP)

Exercise 4: Use the ping command to test connectivity to a website and explain how ICMP is used in this process.

C:\Users\ALMASRIA 4 COMP>ping www.google.com

Pinging www.google.com [142.251.209.4] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 142.251.209.4: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=114
Reply from 142.251.209.4: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=114
Reply from 142.251.209.4: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=114
Reply from 142.251.209.4: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=114

Ping statistics for 142.251.209.4:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 56ms, Maximum = 56ms, Average = 56ms

1.ICMP Echo Request: The ping command sends an ICMP echo request packet to the specified destination IP address. This packet contains a sequence number and a timestamp.
2.ICMP Echo Reply: The destination device receives the ICMP echo request and sends an ICMP echo reply packet back to the source device. The reply packet includes the original sequence number and timestamp, along with a new timestamp.
3.Round-Trip Time (RTT) Calculation: The source device calculates the round-trip time by subtracting the original timestamp from the received timestamp.
4.Displaying Results: The ping command displays the RTT, packet loss, and other relevant information.

Task 8: : Explain what CIDR notation is and how it differs from traditional subnetting
Solution:

CIDR notation is a more flexible way of representing IP adresses and their associated subnet masks. it simplifies subnetting by using a single slash notation to denote the number of network bits.
